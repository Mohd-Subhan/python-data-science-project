# python-data-science-project
A Python data analysis project that explores age distribution using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy. Includes detailed visualizations and insights with a supporting report

# 📊 Age Distribution - Python Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes age distribution using Python’s data science libraries. It uses real or simulated data to explore and visualize how age is distributed across a dataset.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize age-related data, helping draw insights such as central tendencies, outliers, and distribution shape.

## 📁 Files Included

- `pyCA2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation, visualizations, and analysis.
- `pythonreportNEW.doc`: Report summarizing the project methodology and outcomes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is developed using the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## 📈 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Visualization of age distribution using histograms and box plots
- Summary statistics and insights

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Open `pyCA2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run each cell step by step to see the analysis
